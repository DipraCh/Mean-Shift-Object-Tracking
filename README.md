# Mean-Shift-Object-Tracking

Object tracking is one of the most popular areas of video processing. The main purpose of object tracking is to estimate the position of the object in images continuously and reliably against dynamic scenes. This can be achieved by using the mean shift object tracking algorithm. The mean shift algorithm is an efficient approach to tracking objects whose appearance is defined by histograms. Thus, it can be used to track non-rigid objects by discovering clusters in a smooth density of samples.
